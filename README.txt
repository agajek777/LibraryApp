Application built to make managing the library easier.

It is a project based on a MVC logic, making use of Razor Pages and WEB API. DataBase created with Entity Framework Migrations (code first approach). In a database we have an infomation about current clients, books and reservations. Also I used .Net Core Identity and the registered users are stored in the database. Data is loaded using EF Core + Ajax calls. 
Chat Tab provides clients with the real-time communicator between all users of the app. I used SignalR, Messages API and JS to insert every message into the database via fetch.

Layout bulit using Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, JQuery, Toastr.js, sweetAlert.
